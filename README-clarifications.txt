IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:

We consider that each property has an assigned agent, only one.
We consider that the Rewards_Program is a weak entity hanging from the renter, its information could also be
introduced as optional attributes of the renter.
We consider that one user may have many adresses, and that one adress may have many users (many-to-many).
